# ProjectAIUseCase
Results of a hotel chatbot for International University course Project AI Use Case.

This project is just a proof of concept how it is possible to create a simple chatbot with mcahine learning technology as a Mac OS application.

If you want to create your own project, you need the HotelChatBot.xcodeproj which is a XCode project package which you want to open, the HotelChatBot
folder with all the source files and the script folder which includes a script for setting the version number in the build application.
All other folder contain just generated documentation.
The application is not full tested and just trained with a couple of different sentences. So it has errors and does not have the full wished functionality
but it works.

The documentation of the classes can be opened at

and a tutorial how to improve the machine learning at

Have fun
