 Start and end class of the app. Here it is possible to react on open or termination events.
 There are two functions used. One is to load some classifier trainingdata from a file into the database. This is just for building up a dataset for later use.
 When the app will be terminate we read all the classifier and tagging information we created from the user input and write them into language separated files on the desktop.
